🔐 Password Generator Mini Project
This is a mini project built using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project, we explored several important React hooks such as:
->useState
->usecallback
->useRef
->useEffect
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These hooks work together to manage state, optimize performance, and handle side effects efficiently.
